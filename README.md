# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-Linear-Regression-vs-Random-Forest
This project explores the prediction of energy consumption using machine learning, with a focus on comparing Linear Regression and Random Forest models. It emphasizes understanding evaluation metrics (RMSE and R²) and examines how feature engineering—such as encoding categorical variables and extracting temporal features—affects model performance.
# Energy Consumption Prediction – Model Comparison

## Objective
This project compares Linear Regression and Random Forest models for predicting energy consumption, with emphasis on metric interpretation and the impact of feature engineering.

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Key Results
| Model | RMSE | R² |
|------|------|----|
| Linear Regression | 3,652.99 | 0.0305 |
| Random Forest | 3,427.82 | 0.1463 |

## Insights
- Encoding categorical variables significantly improved model performance.
- Extracting temporal features from date increased explanatory power.
- Tree-based models captured non-linear patterns better than linear models.

## Focus
The project emphasizes understanding model evaluation metrics and the effect of feature selection rather than maximizing predictive accuracy.
